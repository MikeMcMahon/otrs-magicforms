 MagicForms
 ===========

Provides a method to create dynamic forms in OTRS.  Typically this is a feature add-on or done through complex JavaScript/jQuery magic.  This method creates a new DTL file and the required Perl modules to power this as a server-side component!

Installation 
--------------

Install like any other module, this module should create a field called "MagicForms" this is important later on!

Configuration
--------------

For every queue you want to link your form to update your Config.pm or ZZZAuto file with the following: 
```perl
    # ---------------------------------------------------- #
    # MagicForms Static Config                             #
    # ---------------------------------------------------- #
    $Self->{'MagicForms::Form'} =  {
      'NewDemand'   => 'NewDemand',
      'WebFS'       => 'iServices Support',
      'SecureFTP'   => 'iServices Support',
      'VirtualWorkspace' => 'iServices Support',
      'ICPRequest'  => 'iServices Support',
      'SupportIncident' => 'iServices Support',
      'GCS'         => 'Global Client Services',
    };
```
